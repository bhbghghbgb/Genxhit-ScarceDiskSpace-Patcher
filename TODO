### I haven't touched this since a few days after starting the project
+ UpdateFile as single update file
+ Patch for one file at a time
+ Remake progress for one update file at a time
+ Use rich progress bar, learn to use different bars at a time
+ Use single GameInfo for all update instance
+ Build processer for downloading and patching at same time
- Offline scan mode: scan update files to determine version vs. Online: get latest version from mhy api
- Enhanced verifying: if failed file from GAME then redownload using ScatteredFiles, else redownload full Language
- Use multiprocessing instead of threading
